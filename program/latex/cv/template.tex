\section{other information}

\subsection{Review}

An joined altair as a mechanics engineer fisrtly offers enterprise work to OEMs, there he get familiar with
how program manages, and how team could efficiently worked together on the same target

{\small \begin{itemize}
  \item Crash report automatic generation for either  simulation data set or experimental
  \item Rapid Modeling process design to improve efficiency
\end{itemize}}


then due to his knowlegde to programming and Linux, he moved to department which focus on scientific caculation.
Here he first known web application, front-end and back-end of the interfaces.
{\small
\begin{itemize}
  \item analyse mpi jobs to improve it's efficiency
  \item develop processing for those support checkpoint
  \item trying to integrate the processing to other domain other than manufacture (EDA / Chemistry )
  \item Remote Visualization for HPC (Altair Display Manager)
  \item Cooperate with Web Application Engineer to develop new feature to improve user experience
  \item develop variety tools to improve HPC solution based on PBS professional and Compute Manager
\end{itemize}}

after that, he realize that cloud computing is booming, mean while Altair announced that PBS Professional goes opensourced. And focus on digest the deep requires stems from customs. 
{\small \begin{itemize}
\item develop a simple load balance system for windows cluster (python)
\item analyse the HPC data  to find bottleneck of the IaaS
\item compares Cluster (HPC) with big data (Hadoop etc.), trying to find a bridge connect those two.
\end{itemize}}

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.

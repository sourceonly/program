\section{Reviews}
\footnotesize
\subsection{{\small software solutions}}
An developed several Platform for customers, there he got familiar with Agile \& and scrum methodologies, which provides the ability from incrementally development of softwares
Projects including:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Rapid modeling system for automobile
  \item Crash report automatic generation for automobile
  \item Platform developed for lokomobile
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{{\small HPC solutions}}
After that, An got familiar with Linux and parallel system through High performance Computing, such as PBS professional, IBM lsf as well as slurm, along with a lot of MPI processes such as platform-mpi and intel mpi, analysing the bottleneck of traditionally HPC. 
Projects including:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Fluent auto checkpoint  stop/restart
  \item Fastran parallel optimizing
  \item Simple GUI client based on QT
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{{\small HPC enterprise}}
Then, An focused the solutions to HPC, worked together with engineers of web applications, sqls. 
Projects including:
{\small
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Integrating web authetication with cluster 
  \item Integrating cluster management with web-portals
  \item Analysis tools of the HPC cluster usage monitors
  \item Software visualization solutions for clusters.
  \end{itemize}
}

\subsection{{\small bigdata}}

Now, An started to look into bigdata technologies, such as Celery.
Wrote a \href{https://github.com/sourceonly/program/tree/gh-pages/program/python/py-batch-system}{simple schedule system in Python} can work across platform both on Windows and Linux. 

Additionally, An spends a lot of time in pursuiting pricinple of programing and studying lisp (SICP) and algrithom (TAOCP).

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.

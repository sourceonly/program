{\sl Highly abundant numbers} are those numbers $n$ such that $\sigma(m) < \sigma(n)$ for all $m < n$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $\sigma(n)$ is the {\sl sum} of the divisors of $n$. For instance, $12$ is a highly abundant number since the sum of its divisors is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 28$, and no number less than $12$ has a {\sl greater} sum of divis.

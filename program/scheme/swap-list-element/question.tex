Given a linked list and an integer $k$, swap the two list items that are at distance $k$ from the {\it beginning of the list} and distance $k$ from the {\it end of the list}. Be sure to consider the case where the $k$ cross, so that the item $k$ from the beginning of the list is after the item $k$ from the end of the list. For instance, given the list $$(1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5\ 6\ 7)$$ and $k = 2$, you should return the list $$(1\ 6\ 3\ 4\ 5\ 2\ 7)$$ and likewise if $k = 6$. The solution must run in $O(n)$ time, where $n$ is the length of the list.

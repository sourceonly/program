\item[First: ] A kidnapper wants to write a ransom note by cutting characters from the text of a magazine. Given two strings containing the characters of the ransom note and the characters of the magazine, write a program to determine if the ransom note can be formed from the magazine.
\item[Second:] Write a program that operates in linear time that finds the item in a list that appears the most times consecutively.
\item[Third: ] Given two finite streams of integers that are too large to fit in memory, write a program that finds the integers that appear in both streams; it must operate in time linear in the length of the longer of the two streams.

Given an array of integers, return {\bf{indice}} of the two
numbers such that they add up to a specific target



you make assume that each input would have exactly one solution


Given $nums\ =\ [ 2, 7 ,11,15], target = 9$

$$nums[0]+nums[1]=2+7=9$$

return $[0,1]$

Let's consider more generalized case, if we have a list of numbers say$$(a b c d e )$$what you would do is to pick up $n$ number with the sum of number $k$, e.g  if we have a list $$(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)$$
please find $4$ numbers  to get $12$, the answer should be
$(
        (1 2 3 6)
        (1 2 4 5)
)$

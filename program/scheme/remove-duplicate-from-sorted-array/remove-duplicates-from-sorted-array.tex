Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space from another array, you must do this in place with constant memory

e.g
Given input array $A=[1,1,2]$
your function should return length $2$, and $A$ is now $[1,2]$

Follow up for ``Remove Duplicates'', What if duplicates are allowed at most twice (more general, most $n$? )
